My process during this final was to get a head start on the project because this class has been faily diffcult for me. I began with adding bootstrap to my page and I started flipping back and forth between my XD mock up and my code. This was my first time using bootstrap grid and I think its really showed me how simple and effective bootstrap can be. Being able to code all my styles without having to leave my html doc is very beneficial. A challenge that I faced during this process was changing my layout for different screen sizes. I was able to join a zoom call with my prof and get that sorted out. Grid was also challenging at first but i've leanred to adjust to it and now my fear of using grid has been solved. By creating a portfolio i've learned that less is more. Keeping code simple and making use of comments whereever I cna is very crucial to the organization and structure of my final product.
